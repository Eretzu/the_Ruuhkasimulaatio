This simulator is one of my school projects. 
It's meant to simulate humans leaving room while avoiding crashing into each other.

It can be run through eclipse, but it does need scala and scala.swing libraries.
The program can be started with UI.scala file. 

Coordinate-direction are right and down.
Distance-unit is not specified
Simulation speed is about 60 tick in a second. 
Mass-unit is not specified.
Angles use radians.
